About me
======
My research focuses on understanding relations between community formation, settlement patterns, and technological complexity. I aim to identify structural and behavioural variables that control processes of human adaptation. I have experience in basic research, environmental impact assessment, stakeholder management, and cultural heritage management. I use different analytical methods including quantitative and qualitative analysis, geospatial analysis, statistical analysis, network analysis and computational modelling. I also conduct fieldwork in both Colombia and Zambia, exploring diverse landscapes.
